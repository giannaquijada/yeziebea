I'd guess that if I end up doing a Tuesday update again, it'll mostly be to borrow an extra day for the next week. I'm still not used to being half-asleep when I'm writing in the morning, though.

I've noticed more and more posts coming from beginners asking questions along the lines of "how do I get into producing", so I decided to write this guide.

Rather than just "mind powers", i see the Mystic as something more than just psionics, like how the necromancer is more than just summoning dead people. my initial thought was to make it somewhat closer to what the divination school would be, if it had its own class with its own "domains". in previous versions, divination and necromancer schools were so rarely used, that they were often just "opposing schools". in my opinion, games like guild wars and diablo 2 did a marvellous job in terms.
