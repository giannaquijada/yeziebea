For Cold Winter on the PlayStation 2, GameFAQs has 1 FAQ (game guide/walkthrough), 1 cheat, 10 reviews, and 47 critic reviews. What game you enjoyed for the PS2 that kind of fallen into obscurity? For me, the game series Destroy All Humans! which was fun as hell. The second was my favorite. Another is the horror games The Suffering and its sequel The Suffering: Ties That Bind. The latter games heavily fallen into obscurity. Heck, it once was going to have a movie but development hell, and it is safe to say it is cancelled along with a third game. That sucks.

You are Andrew Sterling, a disavowed agent caught in the cat-and-mouse manipulations of a shadow intel. So, there's this post on r/ps3 (https://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/6ym1li/ps3_exclusivesnonpc_multiplatform_games_list/) that has had a crucial role in organizing my PS3 backlog. If you have a PS3 and you're wondering what's it good for today, after so many videogames are being released on current gen platforms, you might want to give it a check. I was curious to see if I could find some list like the one in that post showing what PS2 exclusive games haven't been remastered or released.

Hey my bois! Today, I introduce you the thirty-ninth fan-made champion of this series: Wass Painter of the seasons! It still won’t be featuring any artwork since I still can’t draw anything properly. Though, it will include all the informations about the champion, his skills, talents and cards. Visual informations about the champ and his abilities and finally his voicelines will also be developed. Don’t hesitate to give feedback on balance and design for this champion. Cold Winter is indeed a sleeper, as other reviewers have stated here. It will remind players of both GoldenEye (N64) and Half Life. It deserves to be kept in a first-person-shooter collection.
