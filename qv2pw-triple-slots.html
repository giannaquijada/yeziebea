                            <p> My idiot self bought the case and started building in it. then when i did the last step (mounting the GPU) I realized it wont fit because its to T H I C C. amp#x200B; Anyone know if you can mod the case to fit, or if you can mod the MSI Gaming X Trio 2080ti to fit in the case? Aside from a waterblock. Item Name: ^^ Not sure if this is rare since I've seen listings on eBay for around £90. Triple slot card, I'd imagine it would be fantastic for a retro XP gaming PC but sadly the only suitable board I have has the back of the PCIe slot obstructed by RAM slots. Requires one 6pin and one 8pin power connectors and I imagine a pretty decent PSU. Condition: Dusty but working. So I rolled on one of my reroll accs and got her 3 times!!! I was wondering is it worth it going thru all the chapters again and make 2 star to 3 star girls as my main? I really love her, but I have a main that has lots of natural 4 stars l, but I want to know if she will be worth the time and effort to start anew and eventually compete in mirrors. Will I be able to fit an evga GeForce 1070ti ftw Ultra silent on a gigabyte z370xp sli mother board without blocking anything else or having issues? The description of the gpu says “triple slot” for width and i just want to verify before I buy but I can’t seems to find much info. Any info helps. Thanks!

Hi Smart people! Have an ask for recommendations, My house has a number of switches that are triple plate switches (as an example https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lutron-Claro-3-Gang-Decorator-Wallplate-White-CW-3-WH/100671791 (https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lutron-Claro-3-Gang-Decorator-Wallplate-White-CW-3-WH/100671791)). Each one of the switches control a different outlet somewhere in that room. And in my office (for example) one controls the fan (off/on), one the light There isn't much you can do with those slots to justify these armors (in a gameplay kind of way), such as the Shadow Stalwart Heavy, to have no passive effects in order to have three slots. Since there are other armors which have dedicated passive effects (such as the stealth armor, the Protector Heavy, etc.) and they have two slots, you end up having much more mod variety with them than with these so called 'highly customizable' armors. With a effectless three slots armor, you'd My Question is; how much sea snails do you tend to use before you get a 3 of a kind gear? I've been saving up for some time, and I'm a bit curious. Also, is there any strategies for faster 3 of a kinds besides using certain brands. If I'm not mistaken, artillery novice/expert are key for CB/GL, but I dont know what other skills to add. I don't mind the hunting style. I read on one website that MSI is releasing a enormous R9 290X with their triple-fan and triple-slot GPU ( anyone have any further information about. 
Yo people, Thinking of going for a rx200s soon but I will need a new charger. At the moment I use the Xtar MC2. what are people's recommendations for chargers that can charge 3 18650's consecutively. My main is almost lvl 50 and S rank, and even she doesn't have ANY triple slots. I made a smurf account/alt for fun to grind the ladder stress free, and my first two, 3 slot gears rolled x3 the same subs. WHY IS MY MAIN SO UNLUCKY. It's pretty hard to find these days on the cheap, let me know if you're interested but if the price is to high I may as well pay the outrageous prices that are still available online new. I currently have 6gb, would like a 12-24 upgrade though for the FU-T-U-R-E-R-ER-ER-eRrrrrrrr. It looks like I might have to go with a triple-slot cooler when I get around to upgrading to a 1070. I technically have the space in my case. However, I have a soundcard 3 slots over from the PCI-E 16x slot so there won't be much of an air gap between the top of the cooler and the bottom of the sound card (I have an upside down case so the intake of the GPU cooler is the top of the card). So does anyone have experience of a setup like this where their GPU cooler is up against the back of anothe. I've pretty much decided on an R9 390 and was considering a PowerColor model. It has a backplate, making it triple slot. If I ever wanted to go CrossFire in the future, would I be able to fit it on an ASRock Z97 Extreme4 mobo? EDIT: I'll be using a full tower 
I am putting my current build into a smaller case and have a question for anyone that has tried. If you own a Silverstone ML08 or RVZ02 case, would you say you can fit your GPU in the case with an excess of room / could you slide a case fan under the GPU and it fit? I ask because I own a Powercolor PCS+ R9 390. The card is a dual slot card with a larger depth that gets it labeled as "triple slot". The confusion comes from this. The card could Something about them is really enticing. Let me know what you have and how much you want. GPUs with backplates are preferred. </p>
